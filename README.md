Instructions for the project are documented at:

https://exampledriven.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/spring-boot-aws-elastic-beanstalk-example/

The codebase comes from the barebones spring-boot sample downloaded from:

https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot

and deployed into AWS. 

It is not a premanent site since I am using a free trial versions of AWS.
